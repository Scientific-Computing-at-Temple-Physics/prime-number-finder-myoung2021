#Logic to solving problem:
#input two numbers, check each interger between x1 and x2 to see if they are devisable by any numbers between 2 and sqrt(x2)

print 'Welcome to the prime number finder!  To start, input two positive numbers.  We will return any prime numbers between  (and including) the range.'

x1=raw_input('Smallest number to check:')
x2=raw_input('Largest number to check:')

#defining final print group
primes=[]

print primes
